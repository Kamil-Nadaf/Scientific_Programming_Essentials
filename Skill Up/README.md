# 🚀 AI-Assisted Learning: Computational Astrophysics Mastery

Welcome to **AI-Assisted Learning**, a 12-week guided journey to master **Python**, **Git/GitHub**, **statistics**, **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **AI**—all applied to **computational astrophysics**.

You’ll build real research notebooks using astronomical datasets (HEASARC, Fermi, Swift, Gaia, Kepler) while developing a complete research-ready skillset.

---

## 🌌 Program Philosophy

Learning science and engineering should mirror real research. That means writing reproducible code, committing often, and publishing progress.
From **Week 1**, you’ll integrate:

* Git/GitHub for version control and CI/CD
* Documentation (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Reproducible pipelines (Snakemake/Makefile)
* AI-assisted development (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini)
* GPU optimization and debugging
